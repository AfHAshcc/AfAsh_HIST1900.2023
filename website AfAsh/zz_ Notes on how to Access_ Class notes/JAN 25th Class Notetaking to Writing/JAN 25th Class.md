On Taking Notes, Judith Walkowitz

	Reading up the secondary literature firstly, in order to understand the context.
	Source Notes and Memos from notetaking similar to Obsidian.

[[Researcher's Pass]]
	Ahead of time in order to access archives.

Search results can be saved and put into an index to reconnect the context of the search.
	Obsidian is able to do that.
	Indexing, speak for writing a book rather than an article.

	McOdrum Archives and Special Collection.
		Atom.
		Fonds.

Archivists organize things a little differently from librarians.
	Looking into metadata, and how files are subfiled.

Omni is the Libraries Google.
	usage of synonyms will help connect relatibility for mass research and connecting all the main ideas and relevant info for better clarity and expeditious work,

Library has history search.
