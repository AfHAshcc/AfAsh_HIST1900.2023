	For everyone else _not_ in section 1, we will be doing some in-class exercises on critical reading, note making, obsidian and zotero. **Martha Attridge Bufton** from the library will be leading us through some special cases for finding archival materials and note making from those kinds of materials; see her [plan here.](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/Jan25-w-Martha_AttridgeBufton/)
